## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This app aims to create a UI in the terminal through which a user can enter vehicles with select data, and perform a few actions for a vehicle of their choosing, sometimes based on the information entered. 

This project was primarily focused on getting more practice with object oriented programming, and learning more about how to use assocciated classes, methods, and relationships.

This app allows the user to generate a quality README.md file by following prompts and providing information in the terminal.

I built this project to get practice creating and writing to files, implementing node usage (specifically inquirer), and other basic web development concepts.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

Copy the SSH Key from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dcartolano/README-Generator.git) and perform a git clone into the directory of your choice. Open in VS Code or similar program. In the terminal, run "git i" to download all relevant node modules.

## Usage

Open the integrated terminal from the package.json file, and use "npm run start" to start the app. From there, navigate through the options and features as desired.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
