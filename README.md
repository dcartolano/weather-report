# weather-report

## Description

This app aims to create an app that allows the user to specify a city and view the current weather and 5 day forecast for that city. The app also stores recent searches and allows the user to quickly view the information from those searches.

The app accomplishes this by integrating 3rd party API weather data. This app also utilizes a server, which allows it to be deployed to a website through the use of Render or similar services.
